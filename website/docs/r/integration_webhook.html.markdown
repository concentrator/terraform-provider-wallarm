# wallarm_integration_webhook

Provides the resource to manage integrations via generic webhooks. Webhooks can be used as system log sources. The number of log sources depends on the system complexity: the more components in the system, the greater number of log sources and logs.

The types of events available to be sent via WebHooks:
- Hits detected
- System related: newly added users, deleted or disabled integration
- Vulnerabilities detected
- Scope changed: updates in hosts, services, and domains

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Creates the integration to send notifications via
# webhooks to the provided URL and corresponding HTTP method

resource "wallarm_integration_webhook" "wh_integration" {
  name = "New Terraform WebHook Integration"
  webhook_url = "https://webhook.example.com/api/v1/webhook/"
  http_method = "POST"
  active = true
  
  event {
    event_type = "hit"
    active = true
  }

  event {
    event_type = "scope"
    active = true
  }

  event {
    event_type = "system"
    active = true
  }
  
  event {
    event_type = "vuln"
    active = true
  }

  headers = {
    Authorization = "Basic SGkgYXR0ZW50aXZlIFdhbGxhcm0gdXNlcg=="
    Content-Type = "application/xml"
  }
}
```
